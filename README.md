# TSA Project: Global Temperature Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of global temperature data using Time Series Analysis (TSA) methods. The primary objective is to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and potential anomalies in the temperature data over time.

## Files Included
- `TSA_Project_Global_Temperature.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the project details, code, and analysis.
- `TSA_Project_Global_Temperature.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook version of the project, converted from the R Markdown file.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebook, you need the following:
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- R and necessary R packages (specified in the .Rmd file)
- Python and necessary Python packages (if any)

## How to Use
1. Open the `TSA_Project_Global_Temperature.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
